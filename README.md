cmake --build . -j
./CS101AFinalProj.exe
```

---

### Quick Rebuild

After the initial configuration:

```bash
cd Build
cmake --build . -j
```

> If you modify `CMakeLists.txt` or add new dependencies, re-run `cmake ..`.

---

## 🚀 Running the Multiplayer Server

```bash
cd server
node server.js
```

The server runs on `localhost:9999` by default.  
Players connect by entering the server IP address in the in-game multiplayer menu.

## 🎯 Game Modes

### Single Player
Navigate through a procedurally generated maze, defeat AI enemies, and reach the exit to win.

### Multiplayer - Escape Mode
**Cooperative**: Two players work together to escape the maze. If one player is downed, the other can rescue them by holding `F` nearby. Both players must reach the exit to win.

### Multiplayer - Battle Mode
**Competitive**: Players fight against each other. Destroy your opponent's tank or reach the exit first to claim victory. Collect coins from gold walls to recruit ally NPCs!

---

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

### 1. Logical Resolution System
The game uses a **fixed logical resolution** independent of the actual window size. This ensures:
- **Fair gameplay** across all screen sizes
- **Consistent game mechanics** regardless of display resolution
- Players see the same game area with identical zoom levels

```cpp
// Fixed logical resolution for fairness
static constexpr unsigned int LOGICAL_WIDTH = 1920;
static constexpr unsigned int LOGICAL_HEIGHT = 1080;
static constexpr float VIEW_ZOOM = 0.75f; 
```

### 2. Procedural Maze Generation
Uses a **randomized depth-first search** algorithm with:
- Guaranteed solvable mazes with path from start to exit
- Configurable maze dimensions (Small to Ultra sizes)
- Strategic placement of special walls
- NPC spawn point generation ensuring fair distribution

### 3. Smart AI Pathfinding
AI enemies feature intelligent behavior:
- **A* pathfinding** for optimal route calculation
- **Destructible wall consideration** - NPCs can plan paths through breakable walls
- **Target prioritization** - Enemies track and engage the nearest threat
- **Dynamic re-pathing** when obstacles change

### 4. Real-time Network Synchronization
WebSocket-based multiplayer with:
- **Room-based matchmaking** via room codes
- **State synchronization** for positions, rotations, and actions
- **Maze sharing** ensures identical maps for all players
- **Low-latency event broadcasting** for smooth gameplay

### 5. Spatial Audio System
Audio manager with 3D positioning:
- Sound effects attenuate based on distance from the camera
- Different music tracks for menu, gameplay phases, and climax

---

## 💡 Innovations

### 🌐 Cross-Platform Support
The game supports **seamless online multiplayer** between macOS and Windows players through a unified WebSocket protocol. The Node.js server handles room management and state relay.

### 🧱 Wall System

#### Basic Walls
| Wall Type | Color | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Solid Wall** | Dark Gray | Indestructible barrier, cannot be destroyed |

#### Destructible Special Walls
| Wall Type | Color | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Collectible Wall** | Brown | **Collected into inventory** for later reposition |
| **Gold Wall** | Golden | Awards **2 coins** when destroyed (3 coins can recruit 1 ally NPC) |
| **Healing Wall** | Blue | Restores **25% health** when destroyed |

#### Wall Reposition System
- Destroy **brown collectible walls** to collect them into your inventory
- Press `Space` to enter **Reposition mode**
- Click on any empty tile to place a wall from your inventory
- Use walls strategically to block enemies or create defensive positions


### 🤖 Intelligent NPC System
AI tanks feature multiple behavior modes:
- **Chase** - Pursue detected players using pathfinding
- **Attack** - Engage targets when in line of sight
- **Destroy Walls** - Break through destructible obstacles blocking their path

**Recruit Ally NPCs**: Collect **3 gold coins** (from destroying gold walls) to recruit an NPC to fight alongside you! Allies change their appearance and will attack enemies instead of you.

### ⚖️ Fairness Mechanisms
- **Logical Resolution**: All players see the same game area regardless of screen size
- **Synchronized Random Mazes**: Multiplayer mazes are identical for all participants
- **Balanced Spawn Points**: Players and enemies spawn at predetermined fair locations

### 🎵 Dynamic Audio Experience
- **Adaptive Music**: Background tracks change based on game progress (start → middle → climax when approaching exit)
- **Spatial Sound Effects**: Combat sounds are positioned in 3D space
- **Audio Feedback**: Distinct sounds for different wall types, hits, and actions


### 🗺️ Minimap & Dark Mode: Two Ways to Play

The game offers two distinct visual modes that fundamentally change the gameplay experience:

#### **Normal Mode with Minimap**
In standard mode, players have access to a **real-time minimap** showing the entire maze layout. This transforms the game into a **strategic experience** where you can:
- Track enemy positions and movements  
- Coordinate with teammates in multiplayer
- Make informed decisions about which paths to take

#### **Dark Mode: Pure Tension**
Toggle Dark Mode for an entirely different experience. With **limited visibility** and **no minimap**, every corner becomes a potential ambush. The darkness creates:
- **Heart-pounding exploration** - You never know what's around the next turn
- **Heightened audio awareness** - Sound cues become your primary navigation tool
- **True survival horror atmosphere** - Every enemy encounter is a genuine surprise

#### **🎵 The Climax Mystery**
Here's where it gets *really* intense: when **any player** approaches the maze exit, the background music dynamically shifts to an **adrenaline-pumping climax track**. 

In normal mode, you can check the minimap to see who's close to winning. But in **Dark Mode Battle**? You hear the music change... but you have **no idea** if it's you or your opponent about to claim victory! 

This creates an incredible psychological tension:
- *"Is that me triggering the climax music, or are they about to win?"*
- *"Should I rush to the exit or hunt down my opponent first?"*
- *"They might be one step away from victory and I can't even see them!"*

The combination of audio-driven suspense and visual uncertainty makes Dark Mode Battle the ultimate test of nerves and skill.
